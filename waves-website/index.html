    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Waves (2019), directed by Trey Edward Shults. </li>

        <li>Focuses on the Williams family in South Florida. </li>

        <li>First half: Follows Tyler Williams, a high school senior. He wrestles but is hiding a career-ending injury while self-medicating with drugs.
      After his girflfriend, Alexis, gets pregnant they two argue, and an intoxicated Tyler accidently kills her. 
      He is sentenced to life in prison.</li>

        <li>Second half: Focuses on his sister Emily, who barely appears in the first half. 
      The rest of the film follows her grief as she attempts to forgive, and how the family tries to cope with losing Tyler. 
      She then meets her boyfriend Luke and they help heal each other. This is a healthy relationship vs Tyler’s toxic one. </li>

      </ul>

    <h2>Overall impact</h2>
    <p>
      Waves taught me the value of understanding what it means to be human.
      
      <ul>
        <li>Work ethic: I know I have to put in effort because no one will do it for me even when I already feel ten steps behind.</li>
        <li>Family support: I found a support system in my dad. I finally understood why he pushed me and realized 
          he’s also figuring life out for the first time. </li>
        <li>Humanity and Forgiveness: Tyler’s story showed me that mistakes don’t erase who a person is. Everyone has a story, 
          and extending forgiveness doesn’t mean excusing the harm, but it does mean seeing their full humanity.</li>
      </ul>
