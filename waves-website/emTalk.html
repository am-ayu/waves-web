  <h3>Close Read:</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>The setting is outside in the open air, and Emily’s hair is loose. These details symbolize freedom and openness, showing that both she and her father are finally in a space where healing can happen.. </li>
      <li>Ronald is no longer acting as the strict, controlling parent. Instead, he listens quietly and responds with gentleness, which makes this moment feel different from earlier interactions..</li>
      <li>Emily finally finds release in her father’s comfort. She needs this conversation in order to work through her grief, forgive herself, and begin moving forward.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>How it impacted me</h2>
  
    <ul>
      <li>I’ve been in a place where I blamed myself. 
        I told myself “if only I had done something differently,” but no one was there to say it wasn’t my fault.</li>
        <li>This scene taught me that self-blame doesn’t heal. Love does.</li>
        <li>I learned I can let go of hate toward others and myself. Mistakes don’t have to define the whole relationship or my entire life.</li>
        <li>Like Emily, I realized I could learn from mistakes instead of letting them control me.</li>
    </ul>
