  <h2>Close read</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        “The world doesn’t give a shit about you or me.
        We are not afforded the luxury of being average. We gotta work 10 times as hard just to get anywhere.”</li>
        <li>No music playing.</li>
        <li>Body language: Ron is serious and in Tyler’s face, while Tyler avoids eye contact.</li>
        <li>Framing: the frame is tight and claustrophobic, with very little space between the Tyler and his Dad. 
          This is showing how Tyler feels trapped by expectations.</li>
        <li>Ron is teaching his son a hard truth about survival living as a black man. But the way he says it feels like pressure instead of love, 
          so Tyler gets suffocated by it.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="impact" class="clip-section">
  <h2>How it impacted me</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>It reshaped how I see my own parents’ pressure. They weren’t just being hard on me, they wanted the best for me.</li>
      <li>At the time I felt the pressure, but I now understand where it came from.</li>
      <li>Like Tyler, I’ve felt the weight of having to work ten times as hard. But unlike Tyler, I use it to push myself forward without wasting anyone’s time.</li>
    </ul>>
